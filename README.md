## 🧠 Problem 1: Shivam and the Ice Cream Cart 🍦

**Description:**  
Given Shivam's budget and a list of available ice cream prices, determine if he can buy exactly one ice cream with his budget.

### ✅ Input:
- An integer `budget` (budget ≥ 0)
- A list of integers `iceCreamPrices` (1 ≤ length ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ price ≤ 10⁴)

### ✅ Output:
- `true` if there's a price equal to budget, else `false`

### 💡 Example:
```python
Input: 
budget = 30
iceCreamPrices = [10, 25, 30, 50]

Output:
true
