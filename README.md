## 🧠 Problem 1: Shivam and the Ice Cream Cart 🍦

**Description:**  
Given Shivam's budget and a list of available ice cream prices, determine if he can buy exactly one ice cream with his budget.

### ✅ Input:
- An integer `budget` (budget ≥ 0)
- A list of integers `iceCreamPrices` (1 ≤ length ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ price ≤ 10⁴)

### ✅ Output:
- `true` if there's a price equal to budget, else `false`

### 💡 Example:
```python
Input: 
budget = 30
iceCreamPrices = [10, 25, 30, 50]

Output:
true

## 🧠 Problem 2: Vir's Archery Progress 🏹

**Description:**  
Vir is practicing archery. He takes `n` shots and records the score of each shot (an integer between 0 and 10).  
Shots scoring **7 or more** are considered **good shots**, and those scoring **less than 7** are considered **missed shots**.

### ✅ Input:

- An integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of shots taken  
- A list of `n` integers representing the score of each shot (`0 ≤ score ≤ 10`)

### ✅ Output:

- Two space-separated integers:  
  `good_shots missed_shots`

### 💡 Example:

**Input:**
